## About Me

My name is Travis McKenzie and I live in Beaverton, Oregon with my wife and three children.  I work for Liberty Mutual Insurance as a Senior Business Analyst after spending more than 15 years in our workers compensation claims department handling claims and managing claims teams.  During my time in our claims organization, I developed an interest in how we use data to drive business results and improve outcomes.

I started a masters in data science program at Willamette University in Fall 2023 and will complete this 2-year endeavor at the end of this summer, 2025.

I love working in the insurance industry.  I leverage my technical skills and experience to facilitate insights for leadership.  This helps drive results and solve problems.

## My Portfolio - The Refinery

Here, I share my research, projects, and thoughts on data science and analytics.  I call my website "The Refinery" to reflect how I view and apply the data science process.  It is a process of refinement.  We take data that is simple, or complicated, or scattered, and refine it into something that is usable for business leaders to help innovate and drive improvement.

The Refinery is a work in progress.  I am adding samples from my masters program.  I will also be adding content from some various pet projects and I continue to develop my skill set.

Thank you for visiting The Data Refinery!
