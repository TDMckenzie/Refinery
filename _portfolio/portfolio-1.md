In my data visualization course, my project partner and I evaluated data related to the Portland Trail Blazers and Golden State Warriors.  Here are a few graphs that I created during this project.  Graphs were created using ggplot2 in R.  Data was sourced from Kaggle for seasons from 2010 - 2022.

* Will lead off with one of the graphs I am most proud of.  I think it tells a really cool story about the state of the NBA in relationship to the 3-point shot while also highlighting the next-level performances of Damian Lillard and Steph Curry

* Here are several other visuals that we produced for this project.  There was extensive experimentation with the code to allow us to tell a cool story that contrasted these two teams.
